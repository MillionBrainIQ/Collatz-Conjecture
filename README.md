The Collatz Conjecture (or 3n + 1 problem) is a famous unsolved puzzle. Start with any positive integer: If it's even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture claims that if you repeat this process, you will always eventually reach the number 1, no matter what number you start with. This program shows the path that the user-provided number took, and also gives the highest number reached, along with how long it took to get there.
